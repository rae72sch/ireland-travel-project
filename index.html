            <h3>Why Sligo?</h3>
            <h2>Yeats Country along the Wild Atlantic Way</h2>
            <p>
              County Sligo has breathtaking mountain scenery, lakes, waterfalls and
              beautiful beaches. It is known as Yeats Country as it inspired many of
              the great works of the Nobel Prize winning Irish writer, W.B. Yeats
            </p>
            <p>
              Sligo boasts a stunning, uninterrupted and wild coast, which attracts
              surfers and water sport enthusiasts year-round. The Ox Mountains,
              Benbulben and Knocknarea provide breath-taking, well-marked routes for
              walkers, and there are an abundance of scenic driving and cycling
              routes. With historic sites dating back to early civilisations in
              Ireland, and a modern, vibrant urban culture, Sligo offers an
              enriching visitor experience.

            <h4>About me</h4>
            <p>
              Hi! My name is Rachel and Sligo is my family home. While we only
              moved there in 1992, I had been visiting my grandparents there
              since I was born.
